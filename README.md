# NATool
Introducing Network Alignment Toolkit (NAToll): a lightweight, user-friendly, and highly versatile PyTorch library for implementing various network alignment algorithms. With NAToll, you can effortlessly align networks and leverage its extensive range of functionalities.

# Library for Network Alignment (Graph Alignment)
## Overview
We have developed NATool, an open-source library for network alignment, using Python and PyTorch. The software architecture is depicted in the following Figure, showcasing the robustness and efficiency of NATool's design.

## Algorithms

We integrate eleven representative network-alignment as Encoder and deocder. Their papers and the original codes are given in the following table.
